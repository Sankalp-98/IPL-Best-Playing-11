Indian Premier League(IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India(BCCI) in 2008. There are many apps nowadays that take help of data analysis to predict the best playing 11 for the present match. Before I had started studying Data Analytics, I was simply amazed by such exclamations of formation of a best team with the help of some numbers on a sheet that might determine the players abilities. As I started studying about it, I got more and more interested towards this field. This project is an attempt to utilise my learning so far. Most of the apps takes into account only a single match while building Best Playing 11 . Taking this process a step ahead, I have tried to build All time Best Playing 11 IPL team (Data till IPL 2019)
